    text: 'This overlaps with the helium nanodroplet beam. When resonant with a rovibrational transition of an analyte (e.g., R(0) of OCS), it can absorb a photon. This is followed by rapid relaxation, whereby the analyte transfers the rovibrational energy to the surrounding droplet, which results in the evaporation of helium (1 atom for every 5 cm⁻¹). This causes a decrease in the signal from the mass spectrometer. A "depletion" spectrum is generated by plotting the inverted signal against the wavenumber of the laser.',
